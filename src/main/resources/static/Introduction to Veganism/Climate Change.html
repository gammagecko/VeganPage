        <h4>Climate Change Impacts</h4>
    <a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/what-is-climate-change">An Introduction to Climate Change</a>
        <br><br><i><u>Methane</u></i><br><br>
    Climate change is a major threat to humanity, and its mechanisms are covered in the above link.
    We’ve all heard about carbon dioxide‘s impact on climate change, but CO2 is not the only culprit towards climate change.
    An estimated 36 billion tons of carbon dioxide were emitted into the atmosphere [in 2021] by human activity; roughly 640 million tons of methane were emitted during the same period. (1)
    The amount of methane released is far smaller than the amount of carbon dioxide, but methane is far more destructive over shorter time horizons.
    Over 100 years, [a] ton of methane would trap about 28 times as much heat as [a] ton of CO2. (2)
    Doing some simple math, over a 100 year period, methane is as damaging as 17.9 billion tons of carbon dioxide, or about half as impactful as all the carbon dioxide released into the environment on a yearly basis.
    <br><br>
    So where does this methane all come from?
    Domestic livestock such as cattle, swine, sheep, and goats produce CH4 as part of their normal digestive process.
    Also, when animal manure is stored or managed in lagoons or holding tanks, CH4 is produced.
    Because humans raise these animals for food and other products, the emissions are considered human-related.
    The Agriculture sector is the largest source of CH4 emissions in the United States. (3)
    <br><br>
    <i><u>Nitrous Oxide</u></i><br><br>
    Nitrous Oxide is another climate antagonist.
    One pound of the gas warms the atmosphere some 265 times more than a pound of carbon does over a 100-year period. (3)
    Where does nitrous oxide come from?
    Well, 70% of U.S emissions comes from agricultural soil management, such as application of synthetic and organic fertilizers and other cropping practices, the management of manure, or burning of agricultural residues. (3)
    You may ask yourself, what do fertilizers and cropping practices have to do with animal agriculture?
    Well, all those animals need to eat plants.
    There is a concept called trophic levels, which states that for each additional link in a food hierarchy, many times the energy we obtain from one food source is lost in the process of consumption.
    For each pound of meat we eat, many pounds of plant matter are lost, and fertilizers and cropping practices are involved in all that animal agriculture. (4)
