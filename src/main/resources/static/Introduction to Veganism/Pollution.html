    <h4>Pollution</h4>
    <u><i>Eutrophication</i></u>
  <br><br><a href="https://opencontent.ccbcmd.edu/ccardona2023oceanography/chapter/13-7-eutrophication-geosciences-libretexts/">An Introduction to Eutrophication</a>
  <br><br>Eutrophication is a process driven by agricultural runoff.
  Its mechanisms are described in the above link.
  As discussed in prior sections, reducing animal agricultural production by consuming more plants directly also reduces the amount of plants needed to sustain us.
  Eutrophication is thus reduced by consuming plant agricultural products over animal products.
  “Some of the negative effects of this excessive algae production, or algal blooms, are:
  The production of dangerous toxins that can kill animals and people;
  The creation of “dead zones” (low oxygen hypoxic zones, or no oxygen anoxic zones) in the ocean;
  An increase in the treatment costs for cleaning water; And harm to industries and communities that rely on the affected watershed.” (1)
  <br><br><u><i>Air Pollution</i></u>
  <br><br>“Agricultural air pollution comes mainly in the form of ammonia, which enters the air as a gas from heavily fertilized fields and livestock waste.
  It then combines with pollutants from combustion—mainly nitrogen oxides and sulfates from vehicles, power plants and industrial processes—to create tiny solid particles, or aerosols, no more than 2.5 micrometers across, about 1/30 the width of a human hair.
  The particles can penetrate deep into lungs, causing heart or pulmonary disease.” (2)
