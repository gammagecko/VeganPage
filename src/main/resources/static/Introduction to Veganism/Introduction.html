    <h4>Vegan Philosophy</h4>
    "Veganism is a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practicable—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose;
    and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives for the benefit of animals, humans and the environment.
    In dietary terms it denotes the practice of dispensing with all products derived wholly or partly from animals." (1)
