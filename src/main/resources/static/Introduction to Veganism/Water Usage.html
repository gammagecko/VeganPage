    <h4>Water Usage</h4>
  <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/special-topics/water-science-school/science/groundwater-decline-and-depletion ">An Introduction to Groundwater Depletion</a>
  <br><br>Another huge environmental detriment that accompanies animal agriculture is groundwater depletion.
  A description of the groundwater depletion issue is covered in the above link.
  In 2015, 320000 million gallons of water were estimated to be used in the United States on a daily basis. (1)
  42% of the fresh water withdrawn in 2015 was used as irrigation. In other words, used for cropland in more arid regions. (2)
  Of the 325 million acres of U.S. cropland, almost 200 million is used for livestock feed.
  By these estimates, over 60% of cropland actually goes towards feeding animals. (3)
  As discussed in the previous section, trophic levels mean that for every pound of animal flesh, multiple pounds of plant matter had to be fed to the animal in order to produce it.
  We would be much better off in the future if we conserve our water resources by eating plants directly, not animal products.
